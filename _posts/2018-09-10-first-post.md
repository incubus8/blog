There is a quote blogging is like growing flower. Starting from croping, planting the seed, and give
daily fertilizer for flower prosperity. I've been putting off creating a blog for years now, because
I dreaded being one of those blogs where they put up an enthusiastic "First post!!". Trying to keep
writing something in a month has been a real challenge for me. Hope that it won't drop along the way.

This blog should also represent my work when I hack open source project and combine them together into
my needs. Forgive my english, i aint native speaker. Yet training to be the one by practicing a lot.
Any suggestion and correction are greatly welcomed.
